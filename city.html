<h1> Cities I lived in</h1>

    <div>
        <h2> Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines </h2>
        <img src="cebu.jpg" class="rounded float-end img-thumbnail" width="256">
        <p> Mabuhay! Philippines is a country that has thousands of islands along the pacific ocean.This is a photo of me and a close brother at a place called "Tops". Tops is a very famous tourist spot in Cebu, as you can see the whole city from above. Cebu city is also called the Queen city of the South or the center of Cebu. Cebu is relatively near to Mactan, where there are lots of resorts and massage shops for tourists! Cebu is a very nice place to live as many of the big facilities are near and available.     </p>     
        <h2> Seongnam City, Gyeonggido, South Korea</h2>
        <img src="pangyo.jpeg" class="rounded float-end img-thumbnail" width="256">
        <p> As I come back to Korea to attend university, I went to my father's house which is Seongnam city. Specifically from Seongnam, I stayed at Pangyo, which is also called the Pangyo Techno Valley. It's an area where the top IT companies of Korea are located. Some examples are Nexon, Kakao, and Naver. With this opportunity, I was able to work in a IT company before I got accepted for college. Also, there is a good place to go for a walk like Tancheon, which is connected to the Han River. The scenery is really great every fall or autumn. </p>
