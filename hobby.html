      <h1> Hobbies </h1>
      <p> As much as I have lived in the Philippines for a very long time, most of my hobbies are based in the Philippines. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed my favorite hobbies due to the lack of free time and money. While filling up this page, it feels as if I'm traveling back through time.  </p>
      <h4>1. Scuba Diving</h4>
      <img src="scuba.jpg" class="rounded float-end img-thumbnail" width="256">
      <p> I prefer the ocean more than the mountains, thus my hobbies are very related to water sports/activities. First of which is scuba diving. Scuba Diving is a sport that allows me to explore what's under the ocean. It's much more interesting compared to sight seeing as I can stay close to water creatures. Every time I go for a dive, I feel like exploring something that hasn't been found.   </p>
      
      <h4>2. Jetski</h4>
      <img src="jet.jpg" class="rounded float-end img-thumbnail" width="256">
      <p> In Korea, jetskiing is a sport that requires a license in order to drive. But in the Philippines, they did not require a license so I could just rent it. When I drive full speed in the ocean, it feels like breaking through and making a new way. When the sun is up, water is clean, and with adequate wind - it's the perfect day to go out for riding. </p>
      <h4>3. Traveling</h4>
      <img src="travel.jpeg" class="rounded float-end img-thumbnail" width="256">
      <p>Traveling is a hobby that allows me to explore different types of culture from all around the world. I have not been to many countries but hopefully, I can visit more when I am financially available. As of now, I have been to Singapore, HongKong, and Netherlands. </p>
